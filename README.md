This project focuses on analyzing and predicting a company’s financial performance using Machine Learning techniques. By leveraging historical financial data, the model helps identify trends and make predictions that support business and financial decision-making. This project is suitable for machine learning and data analyst job applications as well as master’s applications in Germany and Switzerland.

Problem Statement

Financial performance depends on multiple factors such as revenue, expenses, growth, and historical trends. The objective of this project is to analyze financial datasets, train a machine learning model, and predict financial performance based on past data.

Machine Learning Approach

The project includes data collection and cleaning, data preprocessing and feature selection, model training, and model evaluation. Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest are used depending on the implementation. Model performance is evaluated using appropriate accuracy or error metrics.
